This is my change calculator. It was fun to create this code. I got to use some math. I really enjoyed making this project. just like it says its a change calculator. You enter the amount you owed and how much you give the tenant. in return it will give you the change you will get back exactly. How many bills and how many coins you will get back. awesome project!!!!!
